      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We value your learning through our Individual and Group class programs. We created a curriculum in such a way that it is attainable and at the same time enjoyable for every learner, young or young-at-heart. At the end of the 12 lessons, our goal is for every student to learn the basic on their chosen instrument or they should have attained the level they desired to accomplish.
      <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our vision doesn't end in learning and playing instruments. We also value your creativity in order to expand your musicianship. We encourage our students to create their own music, or even compose melodies and songs. Learning music is not just about playing your favorite Classical or popular tunes. Our goal is to unleash the creativity in every person.
